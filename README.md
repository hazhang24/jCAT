# Brodus - Electronic educational testing platform

This was my term project for graduation. Brodus is a web application whose purpose is to apply educational tests. In its current form, the platform supports items accocmpanied bt audio, video and image files.

The application was originally crceated in 2012 using Java and a J2EE layered architecture. The application connects to a database (originally MySQL) and does objectc-relational mapping using Hibernate; business rules are created through Enterprise Java Beans (EJB); and finally, the view layer is done with PrimeFaces, a free and open source implementation of Java Server Faces (JSF). Everything is built using Ant.
